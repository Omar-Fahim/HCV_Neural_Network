# HCV Neural Network

## Overview

This project leverages neural network methodologies to analyze Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) data. It is built primarily in Jupyter Notebook and Python, making it suitable for data analysis, machine learning, and visualization tasks related to HCV research.

## Features

- Preprocessing and cleaning of HCV datasets
- Implementation of neural network models for classification and prediction
- Visualization of key metrics and results
- Evaluation of model performance

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python packages (listed in `requirements.txt`)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Omar-Fahim/HCV_Neural_Network.git
cd HCV_Neural_Network
```

2. **Install dependencies**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. **Start Jupyter Notebook**

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Open the notebooks and follow the instructions within.

## Usage

1. Download or prepare your HCV dataset.
2. Open the relevant notebook (e.g., `HCV_Neural_Network.ipynb`).
3. Follow the steps cell by cell, guided by inline comments and explanations.
4. Visualize the output and assess the model’s performance using the provided metrics.

## Project Structure

- `/notebooks/` – Jupyter Notebooks for data processing, analysis, and model training
- `/data/` – Place your HCV datasets here
- `/models/` – Contains saved neural network models
- `README.md` – Project documentation

## Example

Here's a simple Python snippet to load data and train the model:

```python
import pandas as pd
from model import train_model

# Load data
data = pd.read_csv('data/hcv_dataset.csv')

# Train model
model, metrics = train_model(data)
print(metrics)
```
